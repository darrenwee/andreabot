# AndreaBot Manual

## Important Commands
### Who
Usage: `/who`

This tells you who is listening to this bot and who belongs to which groups.

### Yelling

Yells send a message to everyone listening to AndreaBot. You can check this using `/who`.

Usage: `/yell your message to send to everyone here`

Please use yells responsibly as they send to everyone, including the OGL chats! It takes around 10 seconds for a yell to fully propagate to all recipients.

You cannot use `/yell` from group chats.

### Whispering

Whispering is similar to yelling but sends messages to specific groups only. You can see who is in what groups using `/who`.

Usage: `/whisper groups your message to send to the group here`

You cannot use `/whisper` from group chats.

#### Examples

To send a message to all OGL chats:
1. `/whisper ogls Hi OGLs, please ensure that your freshies do not run around.`

To send a message to all COGLs and VOGLs:
2. `/whisper cvogls Hi CVOGLs, please submit this and that to the OWeek comm!`

The same applies to `/whisper cogls` and `/whisper vogls`.

Note that sending to the `ogls` group only sends the message to that house's OGL group chat on Telegram, and not each person individually.

### Time
You can use `/time` to get AndreaBot's time. The same clock can be seen by everyone who sends `/time` to AndreaBot, so you can use this if you need more temporal precision in following instructions.

### Announcement Logs
You can use `/log` and `/vlog` to view past announcements. Note that whispers can still be seen by everyone when they use `/log` and `/vlog`, even if they were not the intended recipients.
